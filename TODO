Housing
- Crate metric of affordability (based on median income, prices per square foot, total price of residence, ...)
- Create heatmap of affordability
- Temporal analysis of how affordability evolves. Maybe look at different metrics since affordability will probably stay the same but housing prices might be rising but just n all regions

Education
- Create metric based on graduation and honours
- Heatmap of metric
- Temporal analysis 
- Barchart with top schools
- Look at ethnicity

Crime
- Make separate heatmap for 
	1. Violations
	2. misdemeanor
	3. fellonies
- Crate heatmap with overlays (checkbox for each kind of crime)
- Heatmap of crimerate (= crime/100k people)
- Temporal analysis to see how different kinds of crimes evolve over time. A map that transitions with a timer would be really cool

Overall
- Craete heatmap with overall score
- Overall score: maps each subsection to a score between 0 and 1
- Give users a slider to give a preference to each subsection between 0 and 1. Use this as weighing factor to calculate overal score
- Create barchart with best neighbourhoods according to users preferences
