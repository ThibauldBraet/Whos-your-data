# Trends in Swiss Society

# Abstract
[TODO: This starting sentence is just to pick up attention. It's open to change
and not particularly important]
It's hard to work for social good when we don't know what is good for society.

Despite the availability of data, it's still difficult for the average
concerned citizen to draw any meaningful conclusions from it. Someone might ask
questions like "I wonder if my governments spending is benefiting me?" or "Has
my the party I voted for actually improved my quality of living in any
measurable way?" But, without the skills and tools to analyze data, they're left
reliant on news sources that are often biased and don't provide them with useful
conclusions.

In this project, we hope to address several such questions, with the end goal of
making it easy for those interested to come to conclusions of their own [TODO:
Maybe narrow the range of questions down? I'll do some prelim analysis tomorrow
and settle on an avenue that is appropriately promising]. Topics of interest
include: 
>"How have changes in political power affected the swiss standard of living and
>lifestyle (e.g. crime rates, incomes, education rates, etc.)"

and
>"How has Swiss federal and cantonal spending changed historically and what
>effects have these changes had on Swiss society (i.e. employment, travelling
>time between City centres, health, etc.)?"

Using visualizations and insightful data groupings, we hope to make these
questions more approachable to the average person. 


# Research questions
[ToDo: I'll actually copy the questions down here once I narrow it down a tad
tomorrow]
See above 

# Dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you
expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs
and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size
and format if relevant.
